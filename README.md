Findings Summary:

Regarding customers who were offered coupons for restaurants with an average cost between $20 and $50:

  Warmer weather appears to correlate with increased coupon acceptance rate.
  
  Income does not appear to have a significant effect on coupon acceptance.
  
  People travelling with a partner seem most likely to accept coupons, compared to those travelling alone, with friends or with kids.
  
  People are more likely to accept coupons with longer expiry times than short, although their acceptance rate of shorter coupon expiry times is higher towards the middle of the day, compared with early morning or later at night.
